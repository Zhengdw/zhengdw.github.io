# [corCTF 2021] smogofwar

## tl;dr

Beat a chess bot in "Smog of War" a variant of chess (almost?) identical to the
[Fog of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_chess) variation of chess by sending two different moves to the server.

Hey, I made a chess website to play my favorite variant, smog of war!
Why don't you check it out and play against my AI. He has some nasty surprises,
but if you beat him I'll give you a flag.. good luck :)

You're also given a zip file named `smogofwar.zip` that presumably has the
contents of the website and the server that handles the chess game.
