Hi I'm David. 
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
I completed a BSc in Combined Honours Computer Science and Mathematics and a
MSc in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. 

My broad interests lie in theoretical computer science, predominantly in algorithms and data structures. I enjoy thinking about problems with graphs and geometry.
