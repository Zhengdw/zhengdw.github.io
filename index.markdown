# About 

Hi, I'm David. 
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
I completed a BSc in Combined Honours Computer Science and Mathematics and a
MSc in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. 

My broad interests lie in theoretical computer science, predominantly in algorithms and data structures. I enjoy thinking about problems involving graphs and geometry.  

You can see a list of my papers [here](\publications.html). I'll put a webcv on here too someday.

### Other Activities
I was involved in competitive programming at UBC. I went to ICPC world finals 2018 and 2019, and was the coach of the 2020 and 2021 UBC team (both of which qualified for world finals).

I started playing in some Capture the Flag (CTF) events for fun in 2021. You can see some of my writeups [here](/blog.html).
